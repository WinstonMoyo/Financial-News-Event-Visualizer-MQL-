# Financial-News-Event-Visualizer-MQL-
This project is a custom-built indicator for MetaTrader (MQL4/MQL5) that automatically parses financial news data from an external Excel/CSV file and plots key events on a financial chart. The indicator allows traders to visualize upcoming economic events in real time, with customizable line styles (color, width, and type) to enhance readability.
